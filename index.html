                Flowers carry a lot of importance in our lives. In India, no worship of God is complete without some
                kind of flower. Devotees make a garland of flowers to dedicate it to God. In addition, we also use
                flowers for special occasions like weddings.
                The bride and groom wear garlands of flowers to signify their marriage. In addition, flowers smell so
                good that we use it in different places by planting them in our garden. This way, the beauty of our
                place enhances.
                Flowers carry importance in each nook and corner of the world. They also come in use for making
                medicines. Similarly, we also make difference in fragrance perfumes from the flowers. Further, the
                butterflies, birds and bees take the flowers as food.
